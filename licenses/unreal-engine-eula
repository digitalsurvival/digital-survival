                        Unreal® Engine End User License Agreement

Please read this Agreement carefully. It is a legal document that explains your rights and
obligations related to your use of the Unreal® Engine and related content. By downloading or
using this software or any related content, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, please do not
download or use this software or any related content.

Certain words or phrases are defined to have certain meanings when used in this Agreement.
Those words and phrases are defined below in Section 24.

If your primary residence (or primary place of business, if you are a legal entity like a
corporation or an academic institution) is in the United States of America, your agreement is
with Epic Games, Inc. If it is not in the United States of America, your agreement is with Epic
Games International S.à r.l., acting through its Swiss branch.

If you are separately licensed by Epic under a Custom License, certain terms of this Agreement
do not apply to your Custom Products. Those terms are described below in Section 25.

1. License Grant

Epic grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as described in this
Agreement) license for a single User to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify the
Licensed Technology for any lawful purpose (the “License”). However, the rights that Epic
grants you under the License are subject to the terms of this Agreement, and you may only make
use of the License if you comply with all applicable terms.

The License becomes effective on the date you accept this Agreement or download the Engine
Code or any Content. The License does not grant you any title or ownership in the Licensed
Technology.

Allowed forms of Distribution and Sublicensing

You may only Distribute the Licensed Technology as follows:

       a. Distribution to end users - You may Distribute the Licensed Technology incorporated
          in object code format only as an inseparable part of a Product to end users who are
          subject to an end user license agreement which explicitly disclaims any
          representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the Licensed
          Technology. The Product may not contain any Engine Tools or any Marketplace
          Content Distributed in uncooked source format.

       b. Distribution to other licensees - You may Distribute Engine Code (including as
          modified by you under the License) in Source Code or object code format, or any
          Content, to an Engine Licensee who has rights under its license to the same Version
          of the Engine Code or Content that you are Distributing.

           Any public Distribution (i.e., intended for Engine Licensees generally) which
           includes Engine Tools must take place either through the Marketplace (e.g., for
           distributing a Product’s modding tool or editor to end users) or through a fork of
           Epic’s GitHub UnrealEngine Network (e.g., for distributing source code).

           You also may Distribute Content to an Engine Licensee who is your employee or
           your contractor regardless of whether they have rights under their license to the same
           Content, but only to permit that Engine Licensee to utilize that Content in good faith
           to develop a Product on your behalf for Distribution by you under the License, and
           not for the purpose of Content pooling or any other Distribution or sublicensing of
           Content that is not permitted under this Agreement. Recipients of such a Distribution
           have a limited license to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify that Content to
           develop your Product as outlined above, and for no other purpose.

       c. Distribution and sublicensing of Examples - You may Distribute or sublicense
          Examples (including as modified by you under the License) in Source Code or object
          code format to any third party. However, the rights in this Section 1(c) do not expand
          or modify your limited Distribution and sublicensing rights for Engine Code and
          Content (including as modified by you under the License) that are not Examples.

       d. Distribution of Non-C++ Programming Language Integration - You may Distribute
          an integration of a programming language other than C++ for the Licensed
          Technology, but if you do, the integration must be Distributed free of charge, permit
          Distribution in a Product free of charge on all platforms, and be available in source
          code form (including, but not limited to, any compiler, linker, toolchain, or runtime)
          to all Engine Licensees.

You are permitted to post snippets of Engine Code, up to 30 lines of code in length, online in
public forums for the sole purpose of discussing the content of the snippet and not for the
purpose of enabling non-Engine Licensees to use or modify any Engine Code, or to aggregate,
recombine, or reconstruct any larger portion of the Engine Code.

You may not sublicense the Licensed Technology in Source Code format. You may not
sublicense the Licensed Technology in object code format, or any Content, except to grant end
users the ability to use, or to permit your publishers and distributors to market and Distribute, a
Product that you Distribute as permitted in Section 1(a) above. This paragraph does not limit
your rights to Distribute and sublicense Examples.

When you generate revenue from a Product or Distribute it to end users, you must provide Epic
with advance notification at unrealengine.com/release, as early as reasonably possible, including
the name of the Product, the format of distribution, unique Product id (where applicable), and the
distribution channel(s).

Other Restrictions

UE-Only Content

For UE-Only Content, you may exercise your rights under the License only if and to the extent
that the UE-Only Content is utilized in combination with the Engine Code. For example, you
may not develop or Distribute a Product that consists of or contains UE-Only Content but does
not contain and require the Engine Code (including as modified by you under the License) for its
use. The UE-Only Content will be subject to all of the terms of this Agreement that apply to
Content, as well as the additional limitations described in this paragraph. All references in this
paragraph to UE-Only Content include modified versions thereof made by you under the
License.

Non-Compatible Licenses

You may not combine, Distribute, or otherwise use the Licensed Technology with any code or
other content which is covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or
part of the Licensed Technology be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement
(“Non-Compatible License”). Code or content under the following licenses, for example, are
prohibited: GNU General Public License (GPL), Lesser GPL (LGPL) (unless you are merely
dynamically linking a shared library), or Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
License. Code or content under the following licenses, for example, are allowed: BSD License,
MIT License, Microsoft Public License, or Apache License. You may not sublicense the
Licensed Technology under a Non-Compatible License.

General Restrictions

You may not engage in any activity with respect to the Licensed Technology, including as
incorporated into a Product, (1) for any gambling-related activities or Products (as defined by
law in the jurisdiction of use); (2) for operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft
communication systems or air traffic control machines, or for military use in connection with
live combat; (3) in violation of any applicable law or regulation; (4) in which the Licensed
Technology is rented or leased; (5) that misappropriates any of Epic’s other products or services;
(6) in support of a claim by you or any third party that the Licensed Technology infringes a
patent. You also may not sell or grant a security interest in the Licensed Technology.

Limited License for Unreal Tournament Content

Epic grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license, during the Unreal
Tournament Project, for a single User to use, reproduce, and modify the Unreal Tournament
Content for the sole purposes of creating Unreal Tournament Contributions for the Unreal
Tournament Project and creating Unreal Tournament UGC (the “Unreal Tournament
License”). You may not Distribute or sublicense to any person other than Epic, or include in any
product, any Unreal Tournament Content. The Unreal Tournament License does not grant you
any title, ownership rights, or other intellectual property rights in any Unreal Tournament
Content. You agree to retain and reproduce in all copies of the Unreal Tournament Content the
copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Epic as they appear in the
Unreal Tournament Content. Upon the completion of the Unreal Tournament Project or
termination of the Epic Licenses under Section 16, or upon earlier written notice from Epic if
you materially breach the terms of the Unreal Tournament License, you must destroy all copies
of the Unreal Tournament Content. All references in this paragraph to the Unreal Tournament
Content include modified versions thereof made by you under the Unreal Tournament License.

Any Distribution of Unreal Tournament UGC must take place through the Marketplace, Epic’s
GitHub UnrealEngine Network, or other Epic services, unless such Distribution is solely for the
purpose of legitimate development of such Unreal Tournament UGC, and then only to Engine
Licensees, or legitimate testing of such Unreal Tournament UGC, and then only to Engine
Licensees or individuals who have accepted the latest Unreal Tournament EULA.

2. User License

The Licensed Technology is licensed to you for use by a single User. The User may store the
Licensed Technology on any of the User’s computers, but the Licensed Technology cannot be
shared with others (including any other employees or agents) except through a permitted
Distribution as described above.

In order to access and download the Engine Code and Content, you must set up an Account.
You may not share or allow others to use your Account. You are responsible for the security of
your Account. For questions regarding your Account, please go to unrealengine.com/contact.

Under the License, the User may use the Licensed Technology for as long as you comply with
this Agreement. If you are a legal entity, references to “you” in this agreement also apply to the
User in all cases. You are responsible for the User’s compliance with this Agreement.

If you are an Academic Institution, the limitation to use by a single User does not apply with
respect to the Licensed Technology. Instead, you may store the Licensed Technology on any of
your computers, and you may allow all users of those computers to use the Licensed Technology
(excluding any Marketplace Content) under the License. However, those users are not
authorized under your License to Distribute or sublicense the Licensed Technology (including as
incorporated in a Product) unless they obtain a License of their own.

3. New Versions and Content

During the term of your License, you will be entitled to access future Versions of the Engine
Code and new Content that Epic chooses to make available to you. Epic does not have any
obligation to make new Versions of the Engine Code or new Content available. Nor does Epic
have any obligation to continue to make available for access or download any or all Versions of
the Engine Code or Content. However, any Versions of the Engine Code and Content that Epic
has made available to you, and for which you have accepted any applicable amendment to this
Agreement as described in Section 21, are considered part of the Licensed Technology and may
be used under the License (as amended by that amendment).

Epic may also make Marketplace Content available to you for a fee. Your License to
Marketplace Content is subject to your payment of the associated fee. When you pay the fee to
obtain that Marketplace Content, you are purchasing from Epic the right to have your License
include that Marketplace Content. Regardless of any references Epic may make outside this
Agreement to purchasing or selling Marketplace Content, Marketplace Content is licensed, not
sold, to you under the License.

When you provide payment information to Epic or its authorized processor, you represent that
you are an authorized user of the payment card, PIN, key, account, or other payment method
specified by you, and you authorize Epic to charge such payment method for the full amount of
the transaction.

4. Royalty

You agree to pay Epic a royalty equal to 5% of all worldwide gross revenue actually attributable
to each Product, regardless of whether that revenue is received by you or any other person or
legal entity, as follows:

       a. Gross revenue resulting from any and all sales of a Product to end users through any
          and all media, including but not limited to digital and retail;

       b. Gross revenue resulting from any and all in-app purchases, downloadable content,
          microtransactions, subscriptions, sale, transfer, or exchange of content created by end
          users for use with a Product, or redemption of virtual currency, either within a
          Product or made externally but which directly affect the operation of the Product;

       c. Gross revenue from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign which is
          directly associated with Product access or in-Product benefit (e.g., in a multi-tiered
          campaign, if an amount is established in an early tier solely for Product access, your
          royalty obligation will apply to that amount for each backer with the same access, but
          not on additional amounts in higher tiers based on ancillary benefits);

       d. Your revenue from in-app advertising and affiliate programs;

       e. Revenue from advance payments for a Product (from a publisher or otherwise); and

       f. Revenue in any other form actually attributable to a Product (unless excluded below).

However, no royalty is owed on the following forms of revenue:

       1. The first $3,000.00 in gross revenue for each Product per calendar quarter;

       2. Consulting fees or work-for-hire fees which are non-recoupable for services
          performed using the Licensed Technology (e.g., an architect-created walkthrough
          simulation or a contractor-developed in-house training simulator);

       3. Revenue from a Product which solely relies on the Licensed Technology for
          production of non-interactive linear media (e.g., broadcast or streamed video files,
          cartoons, or movies) and which is Distributed in a form that does not contain the
          Licensed Technology or, in order to deliver, rely on servers running the Licensed
          Technology;

       4. Revenue from a Product which is only Distributed to Engine Licensees (such as
          through the Marketplace);

       5. Revenue from ancillary products which are not software and which do not contain
          embedded information (such as QR codes) which affects the operation of the Product
          (e.g., comic books, soundtracks, apparel);

       6. Financial winnings generated by awards for the Product;

       7. Revenue from donations for a Product which are not tied to Product access or in-
          Product benefits; and

       8. Revenue from interactive amusement park rides or coin-operated arcade games which
          use the Licensed Technology.

The royalty is based on gross revenue from end users, regardless of whether you sell your
Product to end users directly, self-publish via the App Store or any similar store, or work with a
publisher. The following simplified example illustrates the application of the royalty to gross
sales: if your Product earns $10 on the App Store, Apple may pay you $7 (having deducted 30%
as a distribution fee), but your royalty to Epic would still be 5% of $10 (or $0.50).

Royalties that you pay on an advance payment of revenue for a Product that is recoupable by the
payer, such as a publisher, may be credited against future royalty payments that you incur under
this Agreement for that Product.

Within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter in which a Product earns revenue outside
of the above-listed royalty exclusions, you must pay to Epic the full amount of the royalty due
for that quarter and send Epic a royalty report on a per Product basis. Detailed information on
royalty reporting and payment can be found at unrealengine.com/release.

The royalty will be payable under this Agreement with respect to each Product for as long as any
Engine Code or Assets (including as modified by you under the License) incorporated in or used
to make the Product are protected under copyright or other applicable intellectual property law.

5. Payments

Epic reserves the right to charge a 2% late fee, per calendar quarter (compounding), for any
amounts unpaid after the required due date.

You are responsible for all taxes on all payments required to be made by you under this
Agreement (other than taxes that Epic is obligated to pay on its income, which are Epic’s
responsibility). If you are required by a government agency to reduce your payment to Epic for
any reason, you are required to provide sufficient documentation to Epic supporting the
withholding. For questions about withholding taxes or taxes in general, please go to
unrealengine.com/contact.

6. Records and Audits

You agree to keep accurate books and records related to your development, manufacture,
Distribution, and sale of Products and related revenue. Epic may conduct reasonable audits of
those books and records. Audits will be conducted during business hours on reasonable prior
notice to you. Epic will bear the costs of audits unless the results show a shortfall in payments in
excess of 5% during the period audited, in which case you will be responsible for the cost of the
audit.

7. Support

Epic does not have any support obligations with respect to the Licensed Technology under this
Agreement. Support resources may be obtained at unrealengine.com/faq.

8. Feedback and Contributions

If you provide Epic with any Feedback, Epic is free to use the Feedback however it chooses. If
you make any Contribution available to Epic, you hereby assign to Epic all right, title, and
interest (including all copyright, patent, and other intellectual property rights) in that
Contribution for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country. If any
of those rights are not effectively assigned under applicable law, you hereby grant Epic a non-
exclusive, fully-paid, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable license to reproduce, distribute,
publicly perform, publicly display, make, use, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, modify and
make derivative works based on, and otherwise exploit that Contribution for all current and
future methods and forms of exploitation in any country. If any of those rights may not be
assigned or licensed under applicable law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby
waive and agree not to assert all of those rights. However, you may continue to freely use any
Feedback that you provide to Epic, and you may continue to use, in any manner consistent with
the License, any Contribution (including Unreal Tournament Code Contributions) that you make
available to Epic. For Unreal Tournament Content Contributions, you may continue to use those
Contributions only in a manner consistent with the Unreal Tournament License.

You understand and agree that Epic is not required to make any use of any Feedback or
Contribution that you provide. You agree that if Epic makes use of your Feedback or
Contribution, Epic is not required to credit or compensate you for your contribution.

You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights in any Feedback or Contribution that
you provide to Epic to grant Epic and other affected parties the rights described above. This
includes but is not limited to intellectual property rights and other proprietary or personal rights.

9. Third Party Software

The Engine Code includes Third Party Software components. If Third Party Software has
separate software license or attribution requirements, the license terms or other attribution
requirements for Third Party Software components can be found in the installation directory for
each engine version (under the /Engine/Source/ThirdParty/Licenses sub-folder). By entering
into this Agreement and using Third Party Software, you are accepting the terms of those
licenses. In this case, the Third Party Software terms will govern your use of the Third Party
Software, and if there is inconsistency, those terms will take precedence over the terms of the
License for the Third Party Software. You agree that the owners of the Third Party Software are
intended third party beneficiaries to this Agreement in relation to your uses of Third Party
Software.

10. Ownership

Epic or its licensors own all title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in the Engine
Code and Content. You own all rights in the Products you develop under the License, other than
the Engine Code and Content, Third Party Software, and any Contributions. All rights granted to
you under this Agreement are granted by express license only and not by sale, and all of those
rights are limited by the terms of this Agreement. No license or other rights will be created
hereunder by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. Any attempted sublicense under this
Agreement that is not consistent with the terms of this Agreement will be null and void.

11. Proprietary Notices and Attribution

You agree to retain and reproduce in all copies of the Licensed Technology the copyright,
trademark, and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Epic and third parties as they appear
in the Engine Code and the Content.

You agree to place the following notices in the credits for any Product (replacing xxxx with the
current year):

“[Product name] uses the Unreal® Engine. Unreal® is a trademark or registered trademark of
Epic Games, Inc. in the United States of America and elsewhere”

“Unreal® Engine, Copyright 1998 – xxxx, Epic Games, Inc. All rights reserved.”

No other license or right in the Epic Trademarks is granted under this Agreement. All use of the
Epic Trademarks will inure to the sole benefit of Epic. You agree not to engage in any activity
that could tarnish, dilute, or affect the validity or enforceability of the Epic Trademarks or cause
consumer confusion or diminish any goodwill relating to any Epic Trademarks. If you wish to
make further use of the Epic Trademarks, please go to https://www.unrealengine.com/branding-
guidelines-and-trademark-usage.

Epic may use your trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos used with any Product, as
well as publicly released screen shots and video content from the Product, in connection with
Epic’s marketing, advertisement, and promotion of the Unreal® Engine in any and all media
without restriction.

12. Hardware and Usage Data

You acknowledge that, as a default setting, the Engine Code will collect and send to Epic
anonymous hardware and usage data from end users of Products. This functionality is used by
Epic to improve the Engine Code. You may modify the Engine Code under the License to turn
off that functionality in your Product, or you may include in your Product the capability for your
end users to turn off that functionality in the Product.

13. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

The Licensed Technology, the Marketplace, and all other materials and information
provided by Epic (the “Epic Materials”) are provided on an “as is” and “as available”
basis, “with all faults” and without warranty of any kind. Epic, its licensors, and its and
their affiliates disclaim all warranties, conditions, common law duties, and representations
(express, implied, oral, and written) with respect to the Epic Materials, including without
limitation all express, implied, and statutory warranties and conditions of any kind, such as
title, non-interference with your enjoyment, authority, non-infringement, merchantability,
fitness or suitability for any purpose (whether or not Epic knows or has reason to know of
that purpose), system integration, accuracy or completeness, results, reasonable care,
workmanlike effort, lack of negligence, and lack of viruses, whether alleged to arise under
law, by reason of custom or usage in the trade, or by course of dealing. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Epic, its licensors, and its and their affiliates make no
warranty that (1) any of the Epic Materials will operate properly, including as integrated
in any Product, (2) that the Epic Materials will meet your requirements, (3) that the
operation of the Epic Materials will be uninterrupted, bug free, or error free in any or all
circumstances, (4) that any defects in the Epic Materials can or will be corrected, (5) that
the Epic Materials are or will be in compliance with a platform manufacturer’s rules or
requirements, or (6) that a platform manufacturer will approve any of your Products, or
will not revoke approval of any Product for any or no reason. Any warranty against
infringement that may be provided in Section 2-312 of the Uniform Commercial Code or in
any other comparable statute is expressly disclaimed. Epic, its licensors, and its and their
affiliates do not guarantee continuous, error-free, virus-free, or secure operation of or
access to the Epic Materials. This paragraph will apply to the maximum extent permitted
by applicable law.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Epic, its licensors, nor its or
their affiliates, nor any of Epic’s service providers, shall be liable in any way for loss or
damage of any kind resulting from the use or inability to use the Epic Materials or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages
or losses. In no event will Epic, its licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Epic’s
service providers be liable for any loss of profits or any indirect, incidental, consequential,
special, punitive, or exemplary damages, or any other damages arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the Epic Materials, or the delay or inability to use or
lack of functionality of the Epic Materials, even in the event of Epic’s or its affiliates’ fault,
tort (including negligence), strict liability, indemnity, product liability, breach of contract,
breach of warranty, or otherwise and even if Epic or its affiliates have been advised of the
possibility of such damages. These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply
even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability
for consequential or incidental damages, in those states or jurisdictions, the foregoing
limitations of liability shall apply only to the full extent permitted by law.

14. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify, pay the defense costs of, and hold Epic, its licensors, its and their
affiliates, and its and their employees, officers, directors, agents, contractors, and other
representatives harmless from all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses
(including attorneys’ fees, costs, and expert witnesses’ fees) that arise from or in connection with
(a) any claim that, if true, would constitute a breach by you of this Agreement (including,
without limitation, any Distribution or sublicensing of the Licensed Technology in violation of
this Agreement) or negligence by you, (b) any claim brought by any third party to whom you
Distribute or sublicense the Licensed Technology in violation of this Agreement (including
without limitation any claim that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent), (c) any claim that
any Product or any other matter you created, or your exercise of the Epic Licenses, infringes any
third party’s intellectual property rights or other proprietary or personal rights (except to the
extent of any claim that your authorized use of unmodified Engine Code or Content originally
provided to you by Epic under this Agreement infringes any United States patent, trademark or
copyright), or (d) any federal, state, or foreign civil or criminal actions related to any Product.
You agree to reimburse Epic on demand for any defense costs incurred by Epic and any
payments made or loss suffered by Epic, whether in a court judgment or settlement, based on any
matter covered by this Section 14.

If you are prohibited by law from entering into the indemnification obligation above, then you
assume, to the extent permitted by law, all liability for all claims, demands, actions, losses,
liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees, costs and expert witnesses’ fees) that are the
stated subject matter of the indemnification obligation above.

15. Export Compliance

You agree to comply with all applicable federal and foreign laws, regulations, and rules, and
complete any required undertakings. You will obtain any necessary export license or other
governmental approval prior to accessing, downloading, exporting, re-exporting, or releasing the
Licensed Technology. You represent and warrant that you do not appear on any United States list
of prohibited or restricted parties (including the Specially Designated Nationals List).

16. Term and Termination

A. Term of the License. This Agreement will continue in effect unless terminated as described
below.

B. Termination by Epic. Epic may terminate the Agreement by providing written notice if you
materially breach any provision of this Agreement and the breach is not curable or, if it is
curable, you fail to cure the breach within thirty (30) days of notice of the breach from Epic.
Without limiting the foregoing, your failure to make any payment due under this Agreement or
breach of any restriction under the Epic Licenses constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.

C. Termination for Patent Action. The Agreement will terminate automatically as of the date
you commence any claim that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent, or otherwise support
any claim by a third party that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent.

D. Effect of Termination. Upon any termination, the Epic Licenses will automatically
terminate, you may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to you by the Epic Licenses, and
you must destroy all copies of the Licensed Technology in your possession and cease distributing
any Products developed under this Agreement. Within 30 days of termination, unless otherwise
agreed by Epic, you must destroy all Products in your inventory.

E. No Refunds

Except to the extent required by law, all payments, fees and royalties are non-refundable
under all circumstances, regardless of whether or not this Agreement has been terminated.

F. Surviving Provisions

Sections 4-6, 8-10, 12-14, 16-18, and 22-26 will survive termination of this Agreement.

17. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

You agree that this Agreement will be deemed to have been made and executed in the State of
North Carolina, U.S.A., and any dispute will be resolved in accordance with the laws of North
Carolina, excluding that body of law related to choice of laws, and of the United States of
America. Any action or proceeding brought to enforce the terms of this Agreement or to
adjudicate any dispute must be brought in the Superior Court of Wake County, State of North
Carolina or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. You
agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts. You waive any claim of
inconvenient forum and any right to a jury trial. The Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods will not apply. Any law or regulation which provides that the
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this Agreement.

18. Class Action Waiver

You agree not to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney
general action, or collective arbitration related to the Licensed Technology or this
Agreement. You also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration related to the
Licensed Technology or this Agreement with any other action or arbitration without the
consent of all parties to this Agreement and all other actions or arbitrations.

19. U.S. Government End Users

The Licensed Technology and related documentation are “Commercial Items” (as defined at 48
C.F.R. §2.101), consisting of “Commercial Computer Software” and “Commercial Computer
Software Documentation” (as used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable).
The Licensed Technology is being licensed to U.S. Government end users only as Commercial
Items and with only those rights as are granted to other licensees (other than Academic
Institutions) under this Agreement.

20. Independent Contractor

You and Epic are independent contractors and are not the legal representative, agent, joint
venturer, partner, or employee of the other. Neither party has any right or authority to assume or
create any obligations of any kind or to make any representation or warranty on behalf of the
other party.

21. Amendments of this Agreement

Epic may issue an amended Agreement at any time in its discretion by providing notice to
you or by providing you with digital access to the amended Agreement when you next log
in to your Account, access the Marketplace, or download additional Content or new
Versions. You are not required to accept the amended Agreement. However, in order to
continue accessing your Account or the Marketplace or to download or use additional
Content or new Versions, you must accept the amended Agreement. By logging in to your
Account, using the Marketplace, or downloading or using additional Content or a new
Version, you hereby agree to be bound by the amended Agreement then most recently
issued by Epic. If you do not accept the amended Agreement, you may not log in to your
Account, access the Marketplace, download or use additional Content, or download or use
any new Version that is made available by Epic contemporaneously with or after the
issuance of that amended Agreement (but this will not terminate your License for the
Licensed Technology that you downloaded prior to the issuance of the amended
Agreement). If you are a legal entity, acceptance of an amended Agreement by any of your
Users will be binding on you.

22. Notices

Where this Agreement calls for notice from Epic, including written notice, Epic may provide
notice to you at the email address that you provided when you registered for the License (or any
updated email address you subsequently provide). Epic’s notices to you will be effective when
they are sent to that email address.

23. No Assignment

You may not, without the prior written consent of Epic, assign, transfer, charge, or sub-contract
all or any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement, and any attempt without that
consent will be null and void. You also may not transfer your Account. Epic may at any time
assign, transfer, charge, or sub-contract all or any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement. For clarity, you are not prohibited by Epic from assigning or transferring your rights
in your Product, other than the Engine Code, Assets, and Contributions. Third Party Software
assignment and transfer is governed by the terms of the applicable licenses.

royalties, notifications, Feedback, Contributions, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos,
screen shots, and video content related to those Custom Products) related to your use of the code,
artwork, and content that are licensed to you under that Custom License, instead of the terms of

including without limitation all obligations and limitations that apply to use of Marketplace
Content in connection with Products, as well as all disclaimers, limitations of liability, and
indemnification rights of Epic, whether related to Marketplace Content, Products, or otherwise.
Despite this, no royalty is owed under this Agreement on Custom Products, but royalties may be
owed on Custom Products under the terms of a Custom License.

As used in this Agreement, the defined term “Product” does not include Custom Products, and
except as described above, the terms of this Agreement applicable to Products do not apply to
Custom Products.
