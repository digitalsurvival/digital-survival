                        Unreal® Engine End User License Agreement

Please read this Agreement carefully before downloading this software. It is a legal document
that explains your rights and obligations related to your use of the Unreal® Engine. By
downloading or using this software, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, please do not
download or use this software.

Certain words or phrases are defined to have certain meanings when used in this Agreement.
Those words and phrases are defined below in Section 25.

If your primary residence (or primary place of business, if you are a legal entity like a
corporation or an academic institution) is in the United States of America, your agreement is
with Epic Games, Inc. If it is not in the United States of America, your agreement is with Epic
Games International S.à r.l., acting through its Swiss branch.

1. License Grant

Epic grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as described in this
Agreement) license for a single User to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify the
Licensed Technology for any lawful purpose (the “License”). However, the rights that Epic
grants you under the License are subject to the terms of this Agreement, and you may only make
use of the License if you comply with all applicable terms.

The License becomes effective on the date you accept this Agreement or download the Engine
Code or any Assets. The License does not grant you any title or ownership in the Licensed
Technology.

Restrictions on Distribution and Sublicensing

You may not Distribute any Licensed Technology except as follows:

       a. Distribution to end users - You may Distribute the Licensed Technology (including as
          modified by you under the License) incorporated in object code format as an
          inseparable part of a Product to end users who are subject to an end user license
          agreement which explicitly disclaims any representations, warranties, conditions, and
          liabilities related to the Licensed Technology. However, the Product may not consist
          of or contain any Engine Tools (i.e., the Product may not Distribute or statically or
          dynamically link against modules in either the Developer or Editor source folders)
          nor provide functionality allowing the creation of standalone products utilizing the
          Licensed Technology.

       b. Distribution to other licensees - You may Distribute Engine Code licensed to you
          under this Agreement (including as modified by you under the License) in Source
          Code or object code format, or any Asset, to an Engine Licensee who has rights under
          its license to the same Version of the Engine Code or Asset that you are Distributing.

           You also may Distribute an Asset to an Engine Licensee who is your employee or
           your contractor regardless of whether they have rights under their license to the same
           Asset, but only to permit such Engine Licensee to utilize such Asset in good faith to
           develop a Product on your behalf for Distribution by you under the License, and not
           for the purpose of Asset pooling or any other Distribution or sublicensing of Assets
           that is not permitted under this Agreement. Recipients of such Distribution have a
           limited license to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify such Asset to develop
           the Distributing Engine Licensee’s Product as outlined above, and for no other
           purpose. Except as described in this section, you may not Distribute a Premium Asset
           to an Engine Licensee unless that Engine Licensee has purchased a license for the
           same Premium Asset.

       c. Distribution of Example Code - You may Distribute Example Code licensed to you
          under this Agreement (including as modified by you under the License) in Source
          Code or object code format to any third party. However, the Distribution right in this
          Section 1(c) does not expand or modify your limited Distribution rights for Engine
          Code (including as modified by you under the License) that is not Example Code or
          for any Assets.

       d. Distribution of Non-C++ Programming Language Integration – Any Distribution of
          an integration of a programming language other than C++ for the Licensed
          Technology must be Distributed free of charge and be available in source code form
          (including, but not limited to, any compiler, linker, toolchain, or runtime) to Engine
          Licensees.

You are permitted to post snippets of Engine Code, up to 30 lines of code in length, online in
public forums for the limited purpose of discussing the content of the snippet and not for any
other purpose. You may not post any portion of the Engine Code for the purpose of Distributing
Engine Code in a manner not permitted above, or for the purpose of enabling non-Engine
Licensees to use or modify any Engine Code, or to aggregate, recombine, or reconstruct any
larger portion of the Engine Code.

You may not sublicense any Licensed Technology in Source Code format. You may not
sublicense any Licensed Technology in object code format except to grant end users the ability
to use, or to permit your publishers and distributors to market and Distribute, a Product that you
Distribute as permitted in Section 1(a) above. However, you are permitted to sublicense
Example Code, including in Source Code format, to any third party, but this right to does not
expand your sublicensing right to any Licensed Technology other than the Example Code.

When you generate revenue from a Product or Distribute it to end users, you must provide Epic
with advance notification at unrealengine.com/release, as early as reasonably possible, including
the name of the Product, the format of distribution, unique Product id (where applicable), and the
distribution channel(s).

Other Restrictions

UE-Only Assets

For UE-Only Assets, you may exercise your rights under the License only if and to the extent
that such Assets are utilized in combination with the Engine Code. For example, you may not
develop or Distribute a Product that consists of or contains a UE-Only Asset but does not contain
and require the Engine Code (including as modified by you under the License) for its use. The
UE-Only Assets will be subject to all of the terms of this Agreement that apply to Assets, as well
as the additional limitations described in this paragraph. All references in this paragraph to UE-
Only Assets include modified versions thereof made by you under the License.

Non-Compatible Licenses

You may not combine, Distribute, or otherwise use the Licensed Technology with any code or
other content which is covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or
part of the Licensed Technology be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement
(“Non-Compatible License”). Code or content under the following licenses, for example, are
prohibited: GNU General Public License (GPL), Lesser GPL (LGPL) (unless you are merely
dynamically linking a shared library), or Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
License. Code or content under the following licenses, for example, are allowed: BSD License,
MIT License, Microsoft Public License, or Apache License. You may not sublicense Licensed
Technology under a Non-Compatible License.

General Restrictions

You may not engage in any activity with respect to the Licensed Technology, including as
incorporated into a Product, (1) for any gambling-related activities or Products (as defined by
law in the jurisdiction of use); (2) for operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft
communication systems or air traffic control machines, or for military use in connection with
live combat; (3) in violation of any applicable law or regulation; (4) in which the Licensed
Technology is rented or leased; (5) that misappropriates any of Epic’s other products or services;
(6) in support of a claim by you or any third party that the Licensed Technology infringes a
patent. You also may not sell or grant a security interest in any Licensed Technology.

Limited License for Unreal Tournament Content

Epic grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license, during the Unreal
Tournament Project, for a single User to use, reproduce, and modify the Unreal Tournament
Content for the sole purpose of creating Unreal Tournament Contributions for the Unreal
Tournament Project (the “Unreal Tournament License”). You may not Distribute or
sublicense to any person other than Epic, or include in any Product, any Unreal Tournament
Content. The Unreal Tournament License does not grant you any title, ownership rights, or other
intellectual property rights in any Unreal Tournament Content. You agree to retain and
reproduce in all copies of the Unreal Tournament Content the copyright, trademark, and other
proprietary notices and disclaimers of Epic as they appear in the Unreal Tournament Content.
Upon the completion of the Unreal Tournament Project or termination of the Epic Licenses
under Section 17, or upon earlier written notice from Epic if you materially breach the terms of

the Unreal Tournament License, you must destroy all copies of the Unreal Tournament Content.
All references in this paragraph to the Unreal Tournament Content include modified versions
thereof made by you under the Unreal Tournament License.

2. User License

The Licensed Technology is licensed to you for use by a single User. The User may store the
Licensed Technology on any of the User’s computers, but the Licensed Technology cannot be
shared with others (including any other employees or agents) except through a permitted
Distribution as described above.

In order to access and download the Engine Code and Assets, you must set up an Account. You
may not share or allow others to use your Account. You are responsible for the security of your
Account. For questions regarding your Account, please go to unrealengine.com/contact.

Under the License, the User may use the Licensed Technology for as long as you comply with
this Agreement. If you are a legal entity, references to “you” in this agreement also apply to the
User in all cases. You are responsible for the User’s compliance with this Agreement.

If you are an Academic Institution, the limitation to use by a single User does not apply with
respect to the Licensed Technology. Instead, you may store the Licensed Technology on any of
your computers, and you may allow all users of those computers to use the Licensed Technology
under the License. However, those users are not authorized under your License to Distribute or
sublicense any Licensed Technology (including as incorporated in a Product) unless they obtain
a Subscription and License of their own.

3. Subscription and Premium Assets

When you set up your Account, you will be enrolled in a Subscription for the period that you
select at the time that you activate the License (the “Subscription Period”). If you selected a
renewing Subscription Period, your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each
Subscription Period. During your Subscription, you will be entitled to access future Versions of
the Engine Code and Assets that Epic chooses to make available. Epic does not have any
obligation to make new Versions of the Engine Code or Assets available. Nor does Epic have
any obligation to continue to make available for access or download any or all Versions of the
Engine Code or Assets. However, any Versions of the Engine Code and Assets that Epic has
made available to you during your Subscription are considered part of the Licensed Technology
and may be used under the License.

At the time of activation of the License, you will also select a non-refundable subscription fee
(the “Subscription Fee”). You agree to pay the Subscription Fee for each Subscription Period in
advance unless you or Epic have previously cancelled your Subscription.

If you are offered or obtain a product code for a free Subscription Period there will be no
Subscription Fee for such Subscription Period. All such codes are non-transferrable and not for
re-sale.

Epic may also enable you to obtain Premium Assets. Regardless of any references Epic may
make outside this Agreement to purchasing or selling Premium Assets, a Premium Asset is
licensed, not sold, to you under the License. Your License to a Premium Asset is subject to your
payment of the associated additional fee. When you pay the additional fee to obtain a Premium
Asset, you are purchasing from Epic the right to have your License include the Premium Asset.

You acknowledge that Epic may process Subscription Fee payments automatically (e.g., through
charge to a credit card account that you provide). When you provide payment information to
Epic or its authorized processor, you represent to Epic that you are the authorized user of the
card, PIN, key, or account associated with that payment. You authorize Epic to charge your
credit card or process your payment with the authorized processor for any Subscription Fees and
any fees associated with Premium Assets as selected by you.

The Subscription may be cancelled by you at any time at unrealengine.com/dashboard. Epic
may cancel your Subscription if it generally discontinues offering Subscriptions. Cancellation of
your Subscription will be effective at the end of the current Subscription Period for which you
have paid the Subscription Fee. After cancellation of your Subscription by either you or Epic,
you will not be entitled to access or use future Versions of the Engine Code or Assets that Epic
makes available under the License. However, cancellation of your Subscription will not affect
your rights under the License with respect to any Licensed Technology you have already
downloaded under the License.

For questions about your Subscription, please go to unrealengine.com/contact.

4. Royalty

You agree to pay Epic a royalty equal to 5% of all worldwide gross revenue actually attributable
to each Product, regardless of whether such revenue is received by you or any other person or
legal entity, as follows:

       a. Gross revenue resulting from any and all sales of a Product to end users through any
          and all media, including but not limited to digital and retail;

       b. Gross revenue resulting from any and all in-app purchases, downloadable content,
          microtransactions, subscriptions, or redemption of virtual currency, either within a
          Product or made externally but which directly affect the operation of the Product;

       c. Gross revenue from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign which is
          directly associated with Product access or in-Product benefit (e.g., in a multi-tiered
          campaign, if an amount is established in an early tier solely for Product access, your
          royalty obligation will apply to that amount for each backer with the same access, but
          not on additional amounts in higher tiers based on ancillary benefits);

       d. Your revenue from in-app advertising and affiliate programs;

       e. Revenue from advance payments for a Product (from a publisher or otherwise); and

       f. Revenue in any other form actually attributable to a Product (unless excluded below).

However, no royalty is owed on the following forms of revenue:

       1. The first $3,000.00 in gross revenue for each Product per calendar quarter;

       2. Revenue from a Product which is only Distributed to Engine Licensees;

       3. Revenue from linear media which is Distributed in a form that does not contain or, in
          order to deliver, rely on servers running the Licensed Technology (e.g., broadcast or
          most streamed video files, cartoons, or movies);

       4. Revenue from ancillary products which are not software and which do not contain
          embedded information (such as QR codes) which affects the operation of the Product
          (e.g., comic books, soundtracks, apparel);

       5. Financial winnings generated by awards for the Product;

       6. Revenue from interactive amusement park rides or coin-operated arcade games which
          use the Licensed Technology; and

       7. Consulting fees or work-for-hire fees which are non-recoupable for services
          performed using the Licensed Technology (e.g., an architect-created walkthrough
          simulation or a contractor-developed in-house training simulator).

The royalty is based on gross revenue from end users, regardless of whether you sell your
Product to end users directly, self-publish via App Store, or work with a publisher. The
following simplified example illustrates the application of the royalty to gross sales: if your
Product earns $10 on the App Store, Apple may pay you $7 (having deducted 30% as a
distribution fee), but your royalty to Epic would still be 5% of $10 (or $0.50).

Royalties that you pay on an advance payment of revenue for a Product that is recoupable by the
payer, such as a publisher, may be credited against future royalty payments that you incur under
this Agreement for that Product.

Within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter in which a Product earns revenue outside
of the above-listed royalty exclusions, you will pay to Epic the full amount of the royalty due for
such quarter and send Epic a royalty report on a per Product basis. Detailed information on
royalty reporting and payment can be found at unrealengine.com/release.

The royalty will be payable under this Agreement with respect to each Product for as long as any
Engine Code or Assets (including as modified by you under the License) incorporated in the
Product are protected under copyright or other applicable intellectual property law.

5. Payments

Epic reserves the right to charge a 2% late fee, per calendar quarter (compounding), for any
amounts unpaid after the required due date.

You are responsible for all taxes on all payments required to be made by you under this
Agreement (other than taxes that Epic is obligated to pay on its income, which are Epic’s
responsibility). If you are required by a government agency to reduce your payment to Epic for
any reason, you are required to provide sufficient documentation to Epic supporting such
withholding. For questions about withholding taxes or taxes in general, please go to
unrealengine.com/contact.

6. Records and Audits

You agree to keep accurate books and records related to your development, manufacture,
Distribution, and sale of Products and revenue. Epic may conduct reasonable audits of your
records. Audits will be conducted during business hours on reasonable prior notice to you. Epic
will bear the costs of audits unless the results show a shortfall in payments in excess of 5%
during the period audited, in which case you will be responsible for the cost of the audit.

7. Support

Epic does not have any support obligations with respect to the Licensed Technology. Support
resources may be obtained at unrealengine.com/support.

8. Feedback and Contributions

If you provide Epic with any Feedback, Epic is free to use the Feedback however it chooses. If
you make any Contribution available to Epic, you hereby assign to Epic all right, title, and
interest (including all copyright, patent, and other intellectual property rights) in that
Contribution for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country. If any
such rights are not effectively assigned under applicable law, you hereby grant Epic a non-
exclusive, fully-paid, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable license to reproduce, distribute,
publicly perform, publicly display, make, use, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, modify and
make derivative works based on, and otherwise exploit that Contribution for all current and
future methods and forms of exploitation in any country. If any such rights may not be assigned
or licensed under applicable law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby waive and
agree not to assert all such rights. However, you may continue to freely use any Feedback that
you provide to Epic, and you may continue to use, in any manner consistent with the License,
any Contribution that you make available to Epic. For Unreal Tournament Contributions, you
may continue to use such Contributions only in a manner consistent with the Unreal Tournament
License.

You understand and agree that Epic is not required to make any use of any Feedback or
Contribution that you provide. You agree that if Epic makes use of your Feedback or
Contribution, Epic is not required to credit or compensate you for your contribution.

You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights in any Feedback or Contribution that
you provide to Epic to grant Epic and other affected parties the rights described above. This
includes but is not limited to intellectual property rights and other proprietary or personal rights.

9. Third Party Software

The Engine Code includes Third Party Software components. If Third Party Software has
separate software license or attribution requirements, the license terms or other attribution
requirements for Third Party Software components can be found in the installation directory for
each engine version (under the /Engine/Source/ThirdParty/Licenses sub-folder). By entering
into this License and using such Third Party Software, you are accepting the terms of such
licenses. In such case, the Third Party Software terms will govern your use of the Third Party
Software, and will take precedence over the terms of the License for the Third Party Software.
You agree that the owners of the Third Party Software are intended third party beneficiaries to
this Agreement in relation to your uses of Third Party Software.

10. Ownership

Epic owns all title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in the Engine Code and
Assets. You own all rights in the Products you develop under the License, other than the Engine
Code and Assets, Third Party Software, and any Contributions. All rights granted to you under
this Agreement are granted by express license only and not by sale. No license or other rights
shall be created hereunder by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.

11. Proprietary Notices

You agree to retain and reproduce in all copies of Licensed Technology the copyright,
trademark, and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Epic and third parties as they appear
in the Engine Code and the Assets.

12. Attribution

You agree to place the following notices in the credits for any Product (replacing xxxx with the
current year):

“[Product name] uses the Unreal® Engine. Unreal® is a trademark or registered trademark of
Epic Games, Inc. in the United States of America and elsewhere”

“Unreal® Engine, Copyright 1998 – xxxx, Epic Games, Inc. All rights reserved.”

No other license or right in the Epic Trademarks is granted under this Agreement. All use of the
Epic Trademarks will inure to the sole benefit of Epic. You agree not to engage in any activity
that could tarnish, dilute, or affect the validity or enforceability of the Epic Trademarks or cause
consumer confusion or diminish any goodwill relating to any Epic Trademarks. If you wish to
make further use of the Epic Trademarks, please go to unrealengine.com/contact.

Epic may use your trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos used with any Product, as
well as publicly released screen shots and video content from the Product, in connection with
Epic’s marketing, advertisement, and promotion of the Unreal® Engine in any and all media
without restriction.

13. Hardware and Usage Data

You acknowledge that, as a default setting, the Engine Code will collect and send to Epic
anonymous hardware and usage data from end users of Products. This functionality is used by
Epic to improve the Engine Code. You may modify the Engine Code under the License to turn
off that functionality in your Product, or you may include in your Product the capability for your
end users to turn off that functionality in the Product.

14. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

The Licensed Technology and all other materials and information provided by Epic (the
“Epic Materials”) are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, “with all faults” and
without warranty of any kind. Epic and its affiliates disclaim all warranties, conditions,
common law duties, and representations (express, implied, oral, and written) with respect
to the Epic Materials, including without limitation all express, implied, and statutory
warranties and conditions of any kind, such as title, non-interference with your enjoyment,
authority, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness or suitability for any purpose
(whether or not Epic knows or has reason to know of any such purpose), system
integration, accuracy or completeness, results, reasonable care, workmanlike effort, lack of
negligence, and lack of viruses, whether alleged to arise under law, by reason of custom or
usage in the trade, or by course of dealing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Epic and its affiliates make no warranty that (1) any of the Epic Materials will
operate properly, including as integrated in any Product, (2) that the Epic Materials will
meet your requirements, (3) that the operation of the Epic Materials will be uninterrupted,
bug free, or error free in any or all circumstances, (4) that any defects in the Epic Materials
can or will be corrected, (5) that the Epic Materials are or will be in compliance with a
platform manufacturer’s rules or requirements, or (6) that a platform manufacturer will
approve any of your Products, or will not revoke approval of any Product for any or no
reason. Any warranty against infringement that may be provided in Section 2-312 of the
Uniform Commercial Code or in any other comparable statute is expressly disclaimed.
Epic and its affiliates do not guarantee continuous, error-free, virus-free, or secure
operation of or access to the Epic Materials. This paragraph will apply to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Epic, its licensors, nor its or
their affiliates, nor any of Epic’s service providers, shall be liable in any way for loss or
damage of any kind resulting from the use or inability to use the Epic Materials or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages
or losses. In no event will Epic, its licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Epic’s
service providers be liable for any loss of profits or any indirect, incidental, consequential,
special, punitive, or exemplary damages, or any other damages arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the Epic Materials, or the delay or inability to use or
lack of functionality of the Epic Materials, even in the event of Epic’s or its affiliates’ fault,
tort (including negligence), strict liability, indemnity, product liability, breach of contract,
breach of warranty, or otherwise and even if Epic or its affiliates have been advised of the
possibility of such damages. These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply
even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability
for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the liability of Epic,
its licensors, its and their affiliates, and any of Epic’s service providers shall be limited to
the full extent permitted by law.

15. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify, pay the defense costs of, and hold Epic, its licensors, its and their
affiliates, and its and their employees, officers, directors, agents, contractors and other
representatives harmless from all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses
(including attorneys’ fees, costs, and expert witnesses’ fees) that arise from or in connection with
(a) any claim that, if true, would constitute a breach by you of this Agreement or negligence by
you, (b) any claim brought by any third party to whom you Distribute or sublicense the Licensed
Technology in violation of this Agreement (including without limitation any claim that the
Licensed Technology infringes a patent), (c) any claim that any Product or any other matter you
created, or your exercise of the Epic Licenses, infringes any third party’s intellectual property
rights and other proprietary or personal rights (except to the extent of any claim that your
authorized use of unmodified Engine Code or Assets originally provided to you by Epic under
this Agreement infringes any United States patent, trademark or copyright), or (d) any federal,
state, or foreign civil or criminal actions related to any Product. You agree to reimburse Epic on
demand for any defense costs incurred by Epic and any payments made or loss suffered by Epic,
whether in a court judgment or settlement, based on any matter covered by this Section 15.

If you are prohibited by law from entering into the indemnification obligation above, then you
assume, to the extent permitted by law, all liability for all claims, demands, actions, losses,
liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees, costs and expert witnesses’ fees) that are the
stated subject matter of the indemnification obligation above.

16. Export Restrictions

You agree to comply with all applicable federal and foreign laws, regulations and rules, and
complete any required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other
governmental approval), prior to accessing, exporting, re-exporting, or releasing any Licensed
Technology.

17. Term and Termination

A. Term of the License. This Agreement will continue in effect unless terminated as described
below.

B. Termination by Epic. Epic may terminate the Agreement by providing written notice if you
materially breach any provision of this Agreement and the breach is not curable or, if it is
curable, you fail to cure the breach within thirty (30) days of notice of the breach from Epic.
Without limiting the foregoing, your failure to make any payment due under this Agreement or
breach of any restriction under the Epic Licenses constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.

C. Termination for Patent Action. The Agreement will terminate automatically as of the date
you commence any claim that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent, or otherwise support
any claim by a third party that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent.

D. Effect of Termination. Upon any termination, the Epic Licenses will automatically
terminate, you may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to you by the Epic Licenses, and
you must destroy all copies of the Licensed Technology in your possession and cease distributing
any Products developed under this Agreement. Within 30 days of termination, unless otherwise
agreed by Epic, you must destroy all Products in your inventory.

All payments, fees and royalties are non-refundable under all circumstances, regardless of
whether or not this Agreement has been terminated.

F. Surviving Provisions

Sections 4-6, 8-10, 13-15, 17-19, and 23-26 will survive termination of this Agreement.

18. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

You agree that this Agreement will be deemed to have been made and executed in the State of
North Carolina, U.S.A., and any dispute will be resolved in accordance with the laws of North
Carolina, excluding that body of law related to choice of laws, and of the United States of
America. Any action or proceeding brought to enforce the terms of this Agreement or to
adjudicate any dispute must be brought in the Superior Court of Wake County, State of North
Carolina or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. You
agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts. You waive any claim of
inconvenient forum and any right to a jury trial. The Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods will not apply. Any law or regulation which provides that the
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this Agreement.

19. Class Action Waiver

You agree not to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney
general action, or collective arbitration related to the Licensed Technology or this
Agreement. You also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration related to the

Licensed Technology or this Agreement with any other action or arbitration without the
consent of all parties to this Agreement and all other actions or arbitrations.

20. U.S. Government End Users

The Licensed Technology and related documentation are “Commercial Items” (as defined at 48
C.F.R. §2.101), consisting of “Commercial Computer Software” and “Commercial Computer
Software Documentation” (as used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable).
The Licensed Technology is being licensed to U.S. Government end users only as Commercial
Items and with only those rights as are granted to other licensees (other than Academic
Institutions) under this Agreement.

21. Independent Contractor

You and Epic are independent contractors and are not the legal representative, agent, joint
venturer, partner, or employee of the other. Neither party has any right or authority to assume or
create any obligations of any kind or to make any representation or warranty on behalf of the
other party.

22. Amendments of this Agreement

Epic may issue an amended Agreement at any time in its discretion by providing notice to
you or by providing you with digital access to the amended Agreement when you next
access the Engine Code or Assets under your Subscription. You are not required to accept
the amended Agreement. However, in order to download or use new Versions, you must
accept the amended Agreement. By downloading or using a new Version, you hereby agree
to be bound by this Agreement as amended most recently prior to or contemporaneously
with the issuance of that particular Version. If you do not accept the amended Agreement,
you may not download or use any new Version that is made available by Epic
contemporaneously with or after an amended Agreement is issued, and Epic reserves the
right to cancel your Subscription (but this will not terminate your License for Licensed
Technology that you downloaded prior to the issuance of the amended Agreement). If you
are a legal entity, acceptance of an amended Agreement by any of your Users will be
binding on you.

23. Notices

Where this Agreement calls for notice from Epic, including written notice, Epic may provide
such notice to you at the email address that you provided when you registered for the License (or
any updated email address you subsequently provide). Epic’s notices to you will be effective
